i) Noise (Distortion of Data)
In Graphs: Noise would typically be:

Spurious edges (wrong links, very low weight).

Incorrect node attributes.

With NetworkX:

You can detect edges with anomalously low weights (potential noise).

You can verify attribute ranges for nodes/edges.

Manual rules for noise detection (e.g., edges that shouldn't exist based on domain knowledge).

ii) Outliers (Very Different Instances)
In Graphs: Outliers are:

Nodes with unusually high/low degree.

Nodes with unusual centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, closeness, etc.).

With NetworkX:

Compute degree distribution, centrality scores.

Detect nodes in extreme percentiles (top 1% degree, isolated nodes, etc.).

iii) Missing Values
In Graphs: Missing data means:

Nodes/edges missing expected attributes (like 'weight', 'type', etc.).

With NetworkX:

Iterate through nodes/edges to check for missing attributes.

Fill defaults (e.g., weight = 1).

iv) Duplicates
In Graphs: Duplicates could be:

Duplicate edges (MultiGraph can handle, but can be deduplicated if needed).

Duplicate nodes (less common in graphs since IDs are unique, but possible in imported data).

With NetworkX:

Can check for parallel edges in MultiGraphs.

Deduplicate edges if needed.

Validate unique node identifiers.
